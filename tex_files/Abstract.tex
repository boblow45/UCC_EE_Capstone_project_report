\begin{abstract}
The aim of this project is to control the attitude and location of a quad-rotor prototype using the following sensors; 3-axes accelerometer \cite{accelerometer_datasheet}, 3-axis compass \cite{compass_datasheet},3-axes gyroscope \cite{gyroscope_datasheet}, a range finder \cite{rangefinder_datasheet} and a GPS Receiver \cite{GPS_datasheet}


First this report will introduce the concept of a quad-rotor and establish the importance of the project. Next the model will be explained, how the dynamics and kinematics were  modeled,estimated followed by the rotations and frames used to explain and understand the quad-rotor.

 To complete the model, actuators are approximated to first order systems with parameters obtained experimentally. The sensors are approximated using real sensor measurements so the noise can be modeled correctly, thus allowing the noise to be reduced. This lead to the creation of a model in Simulink and the implementation of attitude estimation by means of a Complementary Filter and Kalman Filter whose outputs were used as an input to an attitude controller.Finally the results of note will be presented and discussed. Note this report should be read in conjunction with S.Coulter and R.Christie final year reports.
