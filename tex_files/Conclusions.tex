\chapter{Conclusions}
A full non-linear model of the quad-rotor was developed using Simulink and the ideal filter known as the Kalman filter was investigated. Measurement required for the simulation of the quad-rotor where acquired, examples of which are; system inertial about a given axis, motor speed responses and constants (note this differed from previous years due to the ground effect)\cite{Principles_of_helicopter_aerodynamics}. Conventional controllers where investigated, this where found to be inadequate in their response time. With the new found knowledge of state space it was decided to change to a state space controller method.

Problems with the Arduino and Teensy micro-controller lead the group to move to a new micro-controller which  is more powerful than the previous controllers. To-date the \gls{9dof} sensors  are communicating with the micro-controller and has been calibrated. The non-linear model for the quad-rotor has been created. There is considerable work to be done before this project is completed, but the group believe the goal is achievable.
